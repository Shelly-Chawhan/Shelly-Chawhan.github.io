# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects as a budding software developer.

## About Me

I am an aspiring IT Programmer Analyst, currently studying at LaSalle College. I have a passion for coding and technology, and I enjoy creating web applications and exploring new programming languages.

## How I Created My Portfolio

This portfolio was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of my portfolio.
- **CSS**: To style my portfolio and create an appealing layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and enhancing user experience.

### Development Process

1. **Planning**: I began by sketching the layout and deciding on the sections I wanted to include, such as About Me, Skills, and Contact Information.
2. **Setup**: I created a new repository on GitHub to host my portfolio and set up the project structure locally.
3. **Coding**: I implemented the layout using HTML, styled it with CSS, and added interactive features using JavaScript.
4. **Testing**: I tested the portfolio in different browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
5. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed my portfolio on GitHub Pages for easy access.
